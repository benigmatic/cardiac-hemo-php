# Some notes 
* All template files are taken from the https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-mysql-app-service, but they have an HTML wrap to make the design better, we dont need this
* Those files won't work, cause I removed the  HTML headers and such. But they have good reference on how to acess data and connect to the database and how to run queries. Also, those files are not dealing with unity as input and output. We still need to figure out how to deal with json files.
* As of right now, I am not sure whether you will be able to acess the DB from your PC as there is a firewal rule on the server.
